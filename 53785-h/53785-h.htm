<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>This little work is the outcome of some little
thought, born of hesitation. To be clear, I should
mention that some years ago I completed a somewhat
exhaustive work on the violin, the first portion
of which reached the stereotype stage, but unfortunately
owing to a fire the plates were destroyed. Other
business pressing, the work was laid aside. In the
meantime other books on the violin have been published,
a fact which might be taken as rendering
any further work on the subject superfluous. However,
it has been suggested to me by some musical
friends that if I could produce a popular work which
could be issued at a low price it would be well
received. Buoyed up with this hope, I set to work
with the object of presenting in a concise form such
information as I have thought necessary or at least
<span class="pb" id="Page_iv">iv</span>
of interest to every one who elects to take up the
violin, either as an object of recreation or serious
study. Time alone will prove whether or not the
appearance of this addition to the literature of the
violin is justified.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate my labours I have consulted
the leading British and foreign authorities on the
violin and kindred instruments. I have also during
many years devoted much time to the inspection and
study of genuine old instruments.</p>

<h2>PART I.
<br />HISTORICAL.</h2>
<h3 id="c1">I.&mdash;INTRODUCTORY AND EARLY ENGLISH.</h3>
<p>The origin of the violin is always a very interesting
subject for study. It is one upon which many
great writers have devoted much time and thought,
but as they arrive at varying conclusions, and in
some cases opposite opinions, the result is to leave
the mind of the student in a state of conjecture and
speculation.</p>
<p>In tracing the development of certain species of
stringed instruments the arguments of some authorities
often appear pretty conclusive, but generally
we are confronted with such a mass of contradictory
assertions, that we can only treat the theories put
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
forward as approximate. The professor, teacher
and matured student approaching this subject, of
course do so with great profit, as they are better
able to accept or reject whatever may be said concerning
the ancestry of the violin family, than is
the young beginner.</p>
<p>For those who desire a more extended knowledge
of the rise and progress of the violin family a large
field of literature is open. As a preparatory the
author recommends Otto&rsquo;s &ldquo;Treatise on the Structure
and Preservation of the Violin&rdquo; (W. Reeves,
London), which contains much valuable and interesting
information on the subject.</p>
<p>Now, there can be little doubt but that the
simplest form of stringed instrument (played with
a bow) was conceived from the idea of a stretched
string fixed at two <i>points</i>, vibration being excited
by means of a jagged stick. The earliest known
instrument of this species, according to M. F&eacute;tis (a
great historical writer on the subject) is the ravanastron,
stated to have been invented by an ancient
King of Ceylon, called Ravana, some five or six
thousand years ago. It consisted of a cylinder of
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
sycamore wood, hollowed out from one end to the
other. &ldquo;This cylinder is about 4&#8540; inches long, and
has a diameter of 2 inches. Over one end is
stretched a piece of boa skin, with large scales,
which forms the belly or sound-board. The cylinder
is crossed from side to side&mdash;at one-third of its
length, next the sound-board&mdash;by a rod or shank
of deal, which serves as a neck, of the length of 22
inches, rounded on its under part, but flat on the top,
and slightly inclined backwards. The head of this
neck is pierced with two holes for the pegs, half an
inch in diameter; not in the side, but in the plane
of the sound-board. Two large pegs, 4 inches in
length, shaped hexagonally at the top, and rounded
at the ends which go into the holes, serve to tighten
two strings made of the intestines of the gazelle,
which are fixed to a strap of serpent skin attached
to the lower extremity of the rod or shank. A little
bridge &frac34; of an inch long, cut sloping on the top,
but flat on the part which rests on the sound-board,
and worked out rectangularly in this part, so as
to form two separate feet, supports the strings.
As to the bow, it is formed of a small bamboo, of
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
which the upper portion is slightly curved, and the
lower (nearly) straight. A hole is made in the head
of the bow, at the first knot, for fixing a hank of
hair, which is strained and fixed at the other end,
by binding a very flexible rush string twenty times
round it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such is this most primitive bow instrument, slight
modifications of which still exist in Eastern countries.
The Chinese and Japanese fiddles one often
sees now in music-shops are not at all unlike the
ancient ravanastron. That India appears to have
given birth to bow instruments, and to have made
them known to other parts of Asia, Egypt and afterwards
to Europe, no conjecture is needed, for the
instruments themselves exist, and still preserve the
characteristics of their native originality.</p>
<p>We will now pass over a few thousand years
during which time stringed instruments of great
variety and of every conceivable shape had been
invented and improved upon in different countries
of the world, their gradual development (brought
about, no doubt, more by circumstances existing at
various periods than by any real aim towards artistic
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
achievement) giving birth to the various families
of stringed instruments in use at the present
day, e.g., the violin family, the harp, guitar, mandoline
and pianoforte.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>In tracing the progress of the violin (which the
author will endeavour to do in connection with its
music and performers) it is necessary to content ourselves
with a more definite standpoint, therefore,
we will commence with a period when the viol or
fiddle family came upon the scene, the immediate
precursor of the violin; the viol, in fact, is not inaptly
termed the grandfather of the violin.</p>
<p>The great distinctive feature between a viol and
the present violin family, is that instead of F sound-holes,
viols had C holes. Some had sound-holes in
the shape of what are known as &ldquo;flaming sword&rdquo;
holes. They carried five or six strings, sometimes
more, and the finger-board was mounted with frets,
for (as was then thought) the more certain means of
stopping the notes in perfect tune, an idea which,
to modern violinists, involves an absurdity.</p>
<p>Viols are known to have been in use as early as
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
the fifteenth century (some writers go back to the
thirteenth, but these early ones partook more of the
nature and shape of the guitar than of the subsequent
viol). The viol continued in use up to the beginning
of the reign of Charles I, and was one of the
most popular instruments in its time. There were
generally four in use, viz., treble, alto, tenor and bass,
and occupied in some respects the position now held
by our violin, tenor, &rsquo;cello and double bass. To an
ordinary observer there is little difference in appearance
between the shape of a treble viol and the
earliest violin, so that a considerable latitude of
doubt may be allowed to exist as to the finality of
the former and the adoption of the latter; but certain
it is that the violin of the time became to be
appreciated to such an extraordinary degree, that
the principal viol and lute makers towards the end
of the sixteenth century set about making violins in
the place of viols. Whether the idea of this change
was dictated by the caprice of novelty, or whether
any special demand arose for an instrument of more
extended compass by reason of the advancement
made in the musical compositions of the time, it is
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
difficult to determine with certainty. It is significant,
however, that at this period of the advancement
of the violin, the musical influence of Tallis
(the founder of English church music), and of Bird,
his illustrious pupil, was manifesting itself throughout
this country, and in Italy the music of Palestrina
exercised a similar influence.</p>
<p>In the year 1662 appeared the first work printed
in England containing any reference to the violin.
It was written by one John Playford, and is entitled
&ldquo;A Brief Introduction to the Skill of Musick,&rdquo;
wherein is the following relating to the violin:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The treble violin is a cheerful and sprightly
instrument, and much practised of late, some by
book, and some without; which of these two is the
best way, may easily be resolved. First, to learn
to play by rote or ear, without book, is the way never
to play more than what he can guess by seeing and
hearing another play, which may soon be forgotten,
but, on the contrary, he which learns and practices
by book, according to the rules of musick, fails not
after he comes to be perfect under these rules, which
guide him to play more than ever he was taught
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
or heard, and also to play his part in concert, the
which the other will never be capable of, unless he
hath this usual guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These rules of music are in a plain method, as
it shows in the first six chapters of this book, the
which being perfectly understood, viz., the notes of
the scale or gamut, which directs the places of all
notes, flat and sharp, by which are pricked all lessons
and tunes on the five lines, thus distinguishing
of the several parts by their cliffs, as the treble,
tenor, and basse. Lastly, the names of the notes,
their quantities, proportions, and rests, according to
the rule of keeping time, etc. There then remains
two things to be instructed in, how the violin is
strung and tuned, and secondly, to give you directions
for the stopping the several notes, both flat
and sharp, in their right places. Then, first observe
that this cannot be expressed in words unless on
the neck or finger-board of the violin there be set
five or six frets, as is on the viol. This, though it
be not usual, yet it is the best and easiest way for
a beginner, for by it he has a certain rule to
direct him to stop all his notes in exact tune, which
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
those that do learn without seldom attain so good
an ear to stop all notes in perfect tune. Therefore,
for the better understanding of these following examples,
I shall assign to those six frets on the
finger-board of your violin six letters of the alphabet
in their order&rdquo; (here follow examples), after
which he says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;These few rules (and the help of an able master
to instruct thee in the true fingering, and the several
graces and flourishes that are necessary to be learnt
by such as desire to be exquisite hereon), will in a
short time make thee an able proficient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These quaint instructions would hardly suffice to
meet the requirements of modern violin playing, but
it is interesting to observe the rules and precepts
laid down for the student&rsquo;s guidance over two hundred
years ago. Observe also the recommendation
of frets for accuracy in stopping the notes.</p>
<p>The viol, however, was not destined to die a sudden
death, at any rate, in this country. The soft
wailing tone of the viol still found many admirers,
principally amongst amateurs, who regarded the
violin in the nature of an interloper. Their cause
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
too was vindicated by one Thomas Mace, who,
curious to relate, was born in the same year as John
Playford (1613). This worthy lived in Cambridge,
and in 1676 published a work entitled &ldquo;Musick&rsquo;s
Monument, or a Remembrancer of the best practical
music both Divine and Civil that has ever been
known to be in the world,&rdquo; certainly a most ambitious
title and one that does not in the least suffer
on its comparison with the precepts contained in the
book. He was one of the clerks of Trinity College,
Cambridge, and seemed to have acquired considerable
knowledge of matters musical. Under whom
he was educated, or by what means he became possessed
of so much skill as to be able to furnish matter
for the above work, he has nowhere informed us.
We may collect from it that he was enthusiastically
fond of music, and of a devout and serious disposition,
though cheerful and good humoured.</p>
<p>His knowledge of music seems to have been confined
to the practice of the lute (his favourite instrument)
and the viol. The third part of this work
is devoted chiefly to the viol, and in this he censures
the abuse of music in the number of bass and
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
treble instruments in the concerts of his time, in
which he says, it was not unusual to have but one
small weak-sounding bass viol to two or three
&ldquo;scoulding violins.&rdquo; This disproportion he seeks to
remedy by the observance of the following instructions.
He says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your best provision (and most compleat) will be
a good chest of viols six in number, viz., 2 basses,
2 tenors, and 2 trebles. All truly and proportionably
suited. Of such, there are no better in the
world than those of Aldred, Jay, Smith (yet the
highest in esteem are), Bolles and Ross (one bass of
Bolles I have known valued at &pound;100).</p>
<p>&ldquo;These were old, but we have now very excellent
good workmen who (no doubt) can work as well as
those if they be so well paid for their work as they
were, yet we chiefly value old instruments before
new, for by experience they are found to be far the
best. The reason for which I can no further dive
into than to say, I apprehend that by extream age
the wood (and those other adjuncts) glew, parchment,
paper, lynings of cloath (as some use), but
above all the vernish. These are all so very much
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
(by time) dryed. Linefied, made gentle, rarified, or
(to say better even) agefied, so that that stiffness,
stubbornness, or clunginess, which is natural to such
bodies are so debilitated and made plyable, that the
pores of the wood have a more and free liberty to
move, stir, or secretly vibrate, by which means the
air (which is the life of all things both animate and
inanimate), has a more free and easy recourse to pass
and repass, and whether I have hit upon the right
cause I know not, but sure I am that age adds goodness
to instruments, therefore they have the advantage
of all our late workmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now suppose you cannot procure an entire chest
of viols suitable, etc. Then thus. Endeavour to
pick up (here or there) so many excellent good odd
ones as near suiting as you can (every way), viz.,
both for shape, wood, colour, etc., but especially for
size. And to be exact in that take this certain rule,
viz., let your bass be larger, then your trebles must
be just as short again in the string, viz., from bridge
to nut, as are your basses, because they should stand
8 notes higher than the basses. Therefore, as short
again (for the middle of every string is an 8th) the
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
tenors (in the string) just so long as from the bridge
to F fret because they stand a 4th higher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let this suffice to put you into a complete order
for viols.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have given the above quotation <i>in extenso</i>
without breaking in with any comment, in order that
the student may better understand the peculiar
phraseology used by this ancient authority. The student
will observe that old instruments were equally
valued in those days as in these, and this too was at
a period anterior to the fame of the great Stradivarius,
whose grand period commenced with the
opening of the eighteenth century.<sup><a id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>There appears to be a general consensus of
opinion favouring the theory that Gaspar da Salo,
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
the founder of the Brescian school of violin makers,
who probably worked from 1560 to 1610, was the
first to make violins in their present shape. Be this
as it may, no mention is made of any of his instruments
having found their way into this country at
this period, nor is he mentioned in any way in connection
with the adoption of the violin in this
country, the probability is that our own viol and
lute makers commenced a school of their own,
although nothing definite seems to be known as to
who they were. One thing, however, seems certain,
the early English violin makers were far behind the
Italians in point of workmanship. The English
model was large and clumsy, while that of Italy left
hardly any room for improvement.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>The derivation of the word fiddle<sup><a id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></sup> appears to be
wrapt in obscurity, and must in no way be taken as
coeval with the term violin. According to Strutt,
the antiquary (who wrote a very interesting work last
century on the sports and pastimes of the early English),
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
the name of fiddler was applied to the minstrels
or itinerant musicians of the fourteenth century.
Chaucer, in his &ldquo;Canterbury Tales,&rdquo; mentions the term
in connection with &ldquo;The Clerke of Oxenforde.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">

<p class="t0">A Twenty Bokys clothyd in blacke or rede</p>
<p class="t2">Of Aristotel and hys philosophie</p>
<p class="t">Than robys riche or fidel or sautrie.</p>
</div>
<p>In the &ldquo;Vision of Pierce the Ploughman,&rdquo; we read
&ldquo;not to fare as a Fydeler or a Frier to seke Feastes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would appear that as time went on, these wandering
minstrels or fiddlers sunk very much in
popular estimation, and were held in very low esteem,
so much so, that in the reign of Elizabeth was
passed an Act entitled &ldquo;An Act for the punishment
of rogues, vagabonds, and sturdy beggars,&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></sup> and
amongst the malefactors amenable under this Act
were included &ldquo;&lsquo;Wandering Minstrels&rsquo; (other than
players of interludes belonging to any Barron of
the realm, or any other honourable personage of
greater degree if authorised to play under the hand
and seal of arms of such Baron, or personage&rdquo;) the
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
penalty being &ldquo;such pain and punishment as by this
Act is in that behalf appointed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We hear of the itinerant musician again in an
ordinance from Oliver Cromwell dated 1656, during
his protectorship, which prohibited &ldquo;all persons
commonly called fidlers or minstrels&rdquo; from &ldquo;playing,
fidling and making music in any inn, alehouse
or tavern,&rdquo; and also from &ldquo;proffering themselves,
or desiring or intreating any one to hear them play
or make music in the places aforesaid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great moralist, Owen Feltham, in his &ldquo;Resolves,&rdquo;
1631, also touches upon the subject. Under
his remarks on music we read: &ldquo;It is a kind of disparagement
to bee a cunning fiddler. It argues his
neglect of better employment and that he hath spent
much time upon a thing unnecessarie. Hence it hath
been counted ill for great ones to sing and play like
an arted musician, Philip asked Alexander if hee
was not ashamed that he &lsquo;sang so artfully.&rsquo;&rdquo; In the
&ldquo;Westminster Magazine&rdquo; for February, 1775, is an
article entitled &ldquo;Fiddling Defended,&rdquo; as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some people are unreasonably severe against
Fiddlers, but surely there is no absurdity in attracting
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
the eyes of the fair in displaying a white hand,
a ring, a ruffle, or sleeve to advantage. Who can
blame the performer who is successful enough to
fiddle himself into a good fortune? Whatever the
rigid and austere may think, the approbation of the
ladies is no small spur to a proficiency in music as
well as in many other sciences. It is highly probable
that Achilles (though the blind bard is silent upon
this head) would not have strummed his harp with
so much glee if the ears of Deidamia and Brifeis
had not been tickled by it.&mdash;A FIDDLER.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peacham, in his description of a &ldquo;Compleat
Gentleman,&rdquo; published 1634, addresses his readers
thus: &ldquo;I desire no more in you than to sing your
part sure and at first sight, and withall to play the
same upon your violl or the exercise of the lute
privately to yourselfe&rdquo;&mdash;and in another place he
observes: &ldquo;King Henry the eighth could not onely
sing his part sure but of himselfe compose a service
of foure five and sixe parts&rdquo;&mdash;and we are told that
Queen Elizabeth was a tolerable performer on the
virginals (the precursor of the pianoforte) and also
the violin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>The next source from which any historic information
concerning the fiddle is obtained is from the
writings of one Anthony Wood, of Oxford, who,
although not a professional player, was an enthusiastic
amateur whose opinion was not to be despised.</p>
<p>This worthy in his life written by himself in the
year 1654 gives an amusing account of a musical
escapade which it may not be out of place here to
repeat, as the work is rather scarce and difficult of
access. It throws an interesting light on the state of
music at that period. He says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having by this time got some musical acquaintance,
a frolick by all meanes must be taken by us;
and what should it be, but to disguise ourselves in
poore habits, and like contry fidlers scrape for our
livings? Faringdon Fair this yeare was the place
designed to go to: And all of us (five in number)
lodging in a house in the Middle Rew in Magd.
parish,&mdash;belonging to one Gregory a Chandler, wee
sate out very early the next morning, and calling
first on Mr. Th. Latton&rsquo;s house at Kingston Bak&eacute;puze,
wee bid him good morrow by 2 or 3 tunes. He
came in the hall among us, listened to our musick,
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
gave us money, and ordered drink to (be) carried to
us. After wee had done with him, wee retired to the
In standing on the road going to Farringdon, dined
there, and after dinner wee were entertain&rsquo;d by some
of the neighbours, who danc&rsquo;d (as I remember) on
the Green, gave us some money and victualls, and I
think wee returned very late that evening to Oxon.
The names of those in this exploit were, myself and
Will Bull before mentioned, who played on the
Violins, Edm. Gregorie, B.A., and gent. com. of Mert.
Coll. who play&rsquo;d on the bass viol, John Nap of Trinity
on the citerne, and George Mason, of the said
Coll. on another wyer instrument, but could do nothing.
Soon after we took a voyage northward, called
at Hampton Poyle, played at Mr. Wests&rsquo; house, had
some money, but more drink. Afterwards we went
(I think) to Kidlington, got something there, returned
in the evening, and certain soldiers overtaking
us, they by force, made us play in the open
field, and then left us without giving a penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of my companions would afterwards glory
in this, but I was ashamed, and could never endure
to hear of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>He goes on to relate that by 1656 he &ldquo;had a genuine
skill in musick, and frequented the weekly meetings
of musitians in the house of Will Ellis, late
Organist of St. Johns Coll., situated and being in a
house, opposite to that place whereon the Theatre
was built.&rdquo; Here he gives a list of the company
who met and performed their parts on lutes and
viols. The music masters were: &ldquo;Will Ellis,
Batchelor of Musick, and owner of the house, who
always played his part either on the organ or virginal:&mdash;Dr.
John Wilson, the public professor, the
best at the lute in all England. He sometimes
play&rsquo;d on the lute, but mostly presided (directed)
the consort.&mdash;Curteys, a lutenist, lately ejected from
some choire or cathedral church. Thomas Jackson,
a bass violist.... Ed. Low, Organist lately of
Christ Church. He play&rsquo;d only on the organ; so
when he played on that instrument Mr. Ellis would
take up the counter-tenor viol, if any person were
wanting to perform that part. Gervace Littleton
... a violist; he was afterwards a singing man of
St. Johns Coll. Will Glexney, who had belonged to
a choire before the warr ... he played well upon
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
the bass-viol, and sometimes sung his part....
Proctor, a young man and a new comer. John
Parker, one of the university musitians. But Mr.
Low, a proud man, could not endure any common
musitians to come to the meeting, much less to play
among them. Of this kind I must rank John Haselwood,
an apothecary, a starch&rsquo;d formal clister-pipe,
who usually played on the bass-viol, and sometimes
on the counter-tenor. He was very conceited of his
skill (though he had but little of it) and therefore
would be ever and anon ready to take up a viol
before his betters, which being observed by all, they
usually called him &lsquo;Handlewood.&rsquo; The rest were
but beginners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Proctor died soon after this time, he had been
bred up for Mr. John Jenkyns, the mirrour and wonder
of his age for musick, was excellent for the
lyra-viol, and division-viol, good at the treble-viol,
and treble-violin, and all comprehended in a man of
three or four and twenty years of age. He was much
admired at the meetings, and exceedingly pitied by
all the facultie for his loss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A. W. was now advised to entertain one Will
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
James, a dancing master, to instruct him on the violin,
who by some was accounted excellent on that
instrument, and the rather, because it was said that
he had obtained his knowledge in dancing and
musick in France. He spent, in all, half a yeare with
him, and gained some improvement from him; yet
at length he found him not a compleat master of his
facultie, as Griffith and Parker were not; and, to say
the truth, there was no complete master in Oxon for
that instrument, because it <i>had not hitherto been
used in consort</i> among gentlemen, only by common
musitians, who played but two parts. The gentlemen
in private meetings, which A. W. frequented,
played three, four, and five parts with viols, as
treble-viol, tenor, counter tenor, and bass, with an
Organ, virginal or harpsicon joyn&rsquo;d with them; and
they esteemed a violin to be an instrument only
belonging to a <i>common fiddler</i>, and could not
endure that it should come among them, for feare
of making their meetings to be vaine and fiddling.
But before the restoration of King Charles II, and
especially after, viols began to be out of fashion,
and only violins used, as treble-violin, tenor, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
bass violin; and the King, according to the French
mode, would have 24 violins playing before him
while he was at meales, as being more airie and brisk
than viols.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the year 1658 he informs us that: &ldquo;Tho.
Baltzar, a Lubecker borne, and the most famous
artist for the violin that the world had yet produced,
was now in Oxon. And this day (July 24th), A. W.
was with him and Mr. Ed. Low at the Meeting
house of Will Ellis. A. W. did then and there, to
his very great astonishment, heare him play on the
violin. He then saw him run up his fingers to the
end of the finger-board of the violin, and run them
back insensibly, and all in alacrity and in very good
tune, which he nor any in England saw the like
before. A. W. entertained him and Mr. Low with
what the house could then afford, and afterwards he
invited them to the tavern; but they being engag&rsquo;d
to goe to other company, he could no more heare him
play or see him play at that time. Afterwards he
came to one of the weekly meetings, at Mr. Ellis&rsquo;s
House, and he played to the wonder of all the auditory;
and exercising his fingers and instrument
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
several wayes to the utmost of his power. Wilson,
thereupon, the public professor (the greatest judge
of musick that ever was) did, after his humoursome
way stoope downe to Baltzar&rsquo;s feet to see whether he
had a huff (hoof) on, that is to say, to see whether
he was a devil or not, because he acted beyond the
parts of man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About this time it was, that Dr. John Wilkins,
warden of Wadham Coll., the greatest curioso of his
time, invited him and some of the musitians to his
lodgings in that Coll. purposely to have a consort,
and to see and heare him play. The instruments and
books were carried thither, but none could be persuaded
there to play against him in consort on the
violin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At length the company perceiving A. W. standing
behind in a corner, neare the dore, they haled
him in among them, and play, forsooth he must,
against him. Whereupon he being not able to avoid
it, took up a violin and behaved himself as poor
Troylus did against Achilles. He was abashed at
it, yet honour he got by playing with and against
such a grand master as Baltzar was.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Davis Mell was accounted hitherto the best
for the violin in England, as I have before told you,
but after Baltzar came into England, and showed
his most wonderful parts on that instrument, Mell
was not so admired, yet he played sweeter, was a
well bred gentleman, and not given to excessive
drinking as Baltzar was.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Baltzar occupies a twofold prominence, he was
one of the earliest German performers, and the first
to give any real impetus towards the popularity of
the violin in this country. He is also stated to have
been the first to introduce the practice of &ldquo;shifting.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>During the reign of Charles I, and also during
the Cromwellian usurpation, music was practically
at a standstill. Instrumental music in churches was
prohibited, and the theatres were soon after shut up.
Indeed, as a previous historian of the art has
observed, &ldquo;nothing but syllabic and unisonous
psalmody was authorised or even permitted in the
Church. Organs were taken down; organists and
choirmen reduced to beggary, and the art of music,
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
and indeed all arts but those of killing, canting,
and hypocracy, discountenanced, if not prescribed.
The only demand made for the fiddle was in the
performance of low class music as an accompaniment
to the bacchanalian orgies, in favour during
this profligate period.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, with the restoration of Charles II, came
the restoration of music in this country. The musical
taste of this monarch having been formed in
France during his sojourn there, he was naturally
anxious to introduce the French style into this country,
and as we have seen from the writings of
A. Wood, he emulated the French King, Louis XIV,
by employing a band of twenty-four violins. From
this period, and with this impetus, the epoch of
violin playing in England may be said to date.</p>
<p>The leader of this band of twenty-four violins was
Baltzar; he was succeeded by John Banister, who
was really the first English violinist of any note.</p>
<p>Pepys, in his Diary, under date February 20,
1667, says: &ldquo;They talk how the King&rsquo;s violin Banister
is made. That a Frenchman (Louis Grabu) is
come to be chief of some part of the King&rsquo;s music.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>It is worthy of notice that Banister was sent
abroad by Charles II in order to study music and
acquire the French taste, and so fit himself for the
leadership of the King&rsquo;s band, which post, however,
he soon lost for asserting in the King&rsquo;s hearing that
the English violinists were superior to those of
France, which probably accounts for the note made
by Pepys in his Diary.</p>
<p>Banister must have been a very enthusiastic musician,
for he was the first who publicly advertised
concerts in this country.</p>
<p>The following advertisement is extracted from
the &ldquo;London Gazette,&rdquo; under date Monday, December
30, 1672.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are to give notice, that at Mr. John Bannister&rsquo;s
House (now called the Music School) over
against the George Tavern in White Fryers, this
present Monday, will be musick performed by excellent
Masters, beginning precisely at 4 of the Clock
in the afternoon, and every afternoon, for the future
precisely at the same hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>We have now arrived at the close of the seventeenth
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
century, by which time the supremacy of the
violin was established not only in England, but in
all countries where culture and the fine arts march
hand in hand.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Before bringing this notice to a close, let us glance
briefly at the artistic activity prevailing during the
early part of the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>In his workshop at Cremona would be found the
great violin maker, Antonius Stradivarius, producing
those inimitable instruments which have
rendered him so famous. We find Corelli at the
head of the first school of violinists at Rome (of
which he was the founder), turning out pupils
destined to shed lustre into whatever country they
carried their art, and writing those immortal sonatas,
that will ever retain their high character as
examples of tonal purity, and with Boccherini, laying
the foundation of chamber music.</p>
<p>In 1714 the arrival in England of Geminiani and
Veracini, the great Italian violinists, contributed
to make the violin more popular as well as to
advance the practice of execution. They also supplied
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
the performers on that instrument with compositions
far superior to any they had possessed
prior to their arrival.</p>
<p>The establishment of Italian opera in England
served to raise up a host of violinists, who were not
slow in availing themselves of the facilities afforded
them for studying under the great Italian masters
continually visiting this country. The result has
been, that England at the present day is able to
point with pride to some of the most notable performers
on the violin, as belonging to her ranks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h3 id="c2">II.&mdash;ITALY.</h3>
<p>In musical execution, the early schools of Italy
showed a marked superiority over the rest of
Europe, particularly with regard to the violin.</p>
<p>Corelli, who was born in 1653, was the first to
establish a new school in instrumental composition,
distinguished from that which preceded it by a
graceful, rhythmical and natural manner of writing.
He was the first composer who brought the violin
into repute; and his originality, facility and delicacy
of style, greatly contributed to the popularity
of the violin. He was founder of the Roman, or
what may now be called the ancient school of violinists,
and obtained the proud title of &ldquo;Princeps
Musicorum.&rdquo; After the publication of Corelli&rsquo;s
works, there was scarcely a town in Italy where the
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
violin was not cultivated and in which some distinguished
performer on that instrument did not
reside. Most of his contemporaries formed themselves
on his model&mdash;as Albioni, of Venice, Torelli,
of Verona, Valentini (whose works were published
in Holland), and Marietto, who was a Neapolitan
violinist attached to the household of the Duke of
Orleans.</p>
<p>Tartini, born 1692, the most celebrated performer
on the violin of his day, formed all his scholars on
the solos of Corelli.<sup><a id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></sup> He was the first who observed
the phenomenon of the third sound, which he did in
the year 1714, at Venice. This is the resonance of a
third note when the two upper notes of a chord are
sounded; and may be distinctly heard if a series of
consecutive thirds are played on the violin, they
being perfectly in tune.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Let us now briefly notice the two great Italian
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
schools of violin makers, which, up to the end of the
seventeenth century, had been called into existence.</p>
<p>The first was the Brescian school, the founder of
which was Gasparo da Salo. This maker, as we
have mentioned elsewhere, was the first to introduce
the violin in its present size and shape. The next
representative of this school was John Paul Maggini,
who worked from 1600 to 1640. Other makers
there were, viz., Mariani, Buddiani, Ambrosi, Bente,
Pietro Sancto Maggini (son of J. P. Maggini), but
they call for no special comment.</p>
<p>The next great school was the Cremonese, founded
by Andreas Amati, who was succeeded by his sons,
Antony and Hieronymus Amati, and they worked
together for some time. The most noted of this
family was Nicolas Amati (born 1596, died 1684).
The Cremonese renown for violin making, however,
attained its climax in the productions of Antony
Stradivarius (1644-1737) and Joseph Guarnerius
(1683-1745). The various lesser lights who worked
in these two schools will be duly noticed in the biographical
portion of this work.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>The music of this period falls next to be noticed.
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
Mr. Charles Reade, in his able articles on Cremona
fiddles, which appeared in the August numbers of
the &ldquo;Pall Mall Gazette&rdquo; for 1872, states, &ldquo;Man invents
only to supply a want.&rdquo; This observation is
peculiarly applicable to the violin; for we find that
with the advancement of musical composition came
the desire to attain greater perfection in the art of
violin making. This is illustrated by the fact that
the performance of modern music would be next to
impossible on one of the old violins, by reason of
the then shortness of the neck; hence arises the
necessity for refitting old violins with longer necks,
thus giving the performer greater command over the
high notes, and adding largely to the strength of
the instrument.</p>
<p>The use of the violin in the orchestra began to
receive recognition with the dawn of the seventeenth
century. Monteverde, in his opera of &ldquo;Orfeo,&rdquo;
printed in 1615, scores for &ldquo;two little French violins&rdquo;
(<i>piccoli violini alla Francese</i>).</p>
<p>Without referring to the periods anterior to the
seventeenth century, concerning which we have little
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
or no information, we know that during the first two
generations of that century, music in Italy was
mostly in the madrigal style. The capabilities of
instrumental music, apart from the voice, however,
were soon discovered, and composers entered gladly
upon a new and wide field of musical effort. The
compositions were usually comprehended under the
names of studies, fantasias, capricci, sonatas, concertos
and other pieces in various styles.</p>
<p>Corelli has been accredited with fixing the form
of the sonata, and Torelli, his contemporary, with
inventing the concerto.</p>
<p>When dramatic music began to prevail under
Corelli, it was scientific and rather dry, Geminiani
first enriched it by expression; but it was under Tartini
that it attained the highest degree of expression,
both as to composition and execution. Soon after
this period the concerto was greatly improved in
the hands of Jarnowick and Mestrino, both of whom
were still surpassed by Viotti, who gave to this style
the character which seems so peculiarly its own and
brought it to a degree of perfection which it seems
incapable of exceeding.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>These remarks apply equally to solo as to concerted
music: by which term we understand music
for several voices or instruments, the parts of which
do not stand in the relation of solo and accompaniments,
but are of nearly equal importance; equally
<i>obbligato</i>, either because each of them has its appropriate
part, or because each takes up the strain
successively, the others alternately becoming accompaniments.
This method is practically alike in the
duet, the trio, the quartet, the quintet, and other
pieces where each instrument has its separate part.</p>
<p>Boccherini was the first who, in 1768, gave to these
forms a fixed character. After him came Fiorillo,
Giardini, Pugnani, and lastly, Viotti.</p>
<p>Such was the style of music, so far as the violin
is concerned, from the time of Corelli to the commencement
of this century.</p>
<p>Although Italy has since had to yield the palm
for instrumental music to other countries, we must
not overlook the fact that for generations she held
undisputed sway in the realm of music; both as
regards composers and performers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<h3 id="c3">III.&mdash;FRANCE.</h3>
<p>We will now direct our attention to France.</p>
<p>Towards the latter end of the sixteenth century
the lute was a very favourite and general instrument.
About the year 1577 the violin was introduced
by Baltazarini, a then celebrated performer, who was
sent at the head of a band of performers by Marshal
Brissac to Catherine de Medicis, and was appointed
valet de chambre to the Princess. Beyond this little
appears to be known of him.</p>
<p>We have elsewhere had occasion to refer to the
band of twenty-four violins of Louis XIV. The leader
of this band was a Florentine named Lully, who was
instrumental in introducing the Italian music into
France, thus giving to that country a new musical
existence. The high standard then prevailing in
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
Italy, he, however, failed to maintain, but be this as
it may, the French seemed to have acquired a kind
of distinctive reputation as performers, for M.
Choron says: &ldquo;With respect to the style in which the
French have real and undisputed merit, and, indeed,
in many respects have a marked superiority, is the instrumental
in general, and especially that of the violin....
The excellence of the twenty-four violins of
Louis XIV formed by Lully and of other violinists,
was highly spoken of so far back as the seventeenth
century,&rdquo; and he adds, &ldquo;I do not, however, know how
to reconcile these facts with the following remark of
Corette<sup><a id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></sup> in the preface to his &ldquo;Method of Accompaniment,&rdquo;
published at Paris about the year 1750.
&lsquo;At the commencement of this century&rsquo; (says
Corette) &lsquo;music was very dull and slow,&rsquo; etc....
When Corelli&rsquo;s sonatas were first brought from
Rome (about 1715), nobody in Paris could play
them. The Duke of Orleans, then Regent, being a
great amateur of music, and wishing to hear them,
was obliged to have them <i>sung</i> by three voices. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
violinists then begun to study them, and, at the expiration
of some years, three were found who could
play them. Baptiste, one of these, went to Rome to
study them under Corelli himself,&rdquo; and M. Choron
continuing, says: &ldquo;Be this as it may, since that
period, instrumental music has been studied with
ardour by the French, and they have made astonishing
progress in it. France has now an excellent
school for the violin, founded upon that of Italy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seems rather astonishing to believe that singers
could be found to sing that which took a violinist
years of practice to perform, especially in view
of the fact that France at that period almost
neglected the vocal art, and we must regard Corette&rsquo;s
criticism as somewhat biased, notwithstanding he
was &ldquo;a furious partisan of the French school of
music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No doubt the French had to supply their repertoires
of chamber music (when they required it)
from the Italian composers, the music of France in
Lully&rsquo;s time being mostly composed for the lyric
drama, which was then greatly in vogue.</p>
<p>The first to call into existence a French school
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
was Jean Marie Leclair, who received his instructions
from Somis, an Italian. He does not, however,
appear to have formed any great performers,
owing, probably, to the European fame of the great
Italian masters. According to one historian the real
founder of the French school was Pierre Gavinies,
born at Bordeaux in 1726. Be this so or not, he
certainly produced some fine masters. Indeed, during
the eighteenth century, France was productive
of the finest violinists that had been heard. We have
only to mention such names as Lahousaye, Barth&eacute;l&eacute;mon,
Rode, Kreutzer, Lafont, Baillot, Habeneck and
De Beriot, in proof of this assertion.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>The early records of violin making in France, like
those of other countries, seem buried in obscurity.
Its literature offers but scant information of a reliable
character, and we are therefore compelled to
make the most of such evidence as is afforded by the
slender testimony of paintings and ecclesiastical
monuments.</p>
<p>We are told that Baltazarini was the first to introduce
the violin (or rather the performance of it) into
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
France, in the year 1577, so that it is safe to assume
no maker of any note existed anterior to this period.
One authority tells us that, in the year 1566, the
name of Tywersus of Nancy appears as a lute and
violin maker, and is reported to have assisted Andreas
Amati to finish certain instruments made for
the chapel of Charles IX. Soon after this period
several names of makers are recorded, but little
seems to be known of them, or of their work.</p>
<p>Excellence in violin making seems to have commenced
with the middle of the eighteenth century,
when the name of Nicholas Lupot appears on the
scene as the founder of the French school. Before
he died, however, in 1824, France had given birth to
John Baptiste Vuillaume, in whose hands the construction
of violins attained the utmost perfection.
His instruments are much admired and often realise
large sums of money. Many makers of great merit
have since cropped up, which has had the effect of
establishing France as the greatest producer of the
instrument, the subject of these pages.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<h3 id="c4">IV.&mdash;GERMANY.</h3>
<p>Let us now direct our spirit of inquiry into Germany,
that land of music and musicians. This country,
notwithstanding its present musical position
appears to have been somewhat behind the times in
regard to the production of any early violin performers
of note, and affords the names of fewer
musicians than almost any other country during the
sixteenth century, if we except Spain. An explanation
of this seems to be afforded by the fact of the
wars, which devastated Germany during the latter
part of the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth
centuries, and particularly the terrible Thirty
Years&rsquo; war, during which five great armies overran
that unhappy country, carrying desolation and
havoc in every part of it. These wars destroyed the
arts, which can only flourish in the bosom of peace
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
and happiness. It is certain that at this period the
school of Germany was greatly inferior to that of
Italy; it even appears that the French school began
before the German to emerge from obscurity. Reason
is wanting to account for the German lack of
early performers, but we feel constrained to borrow
the following words from Dubourg. He says:
&ldquo;We may observe, that, although derived originally,
like all others, from that of Italy, and contracting
no inconsiderable obligations to it in its progress, it
has been, on the whole, much less indebted to the
Italians for resources and support, than the school
either of France or England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the early German performers were inferior
as soloists to those of Italy or France, they
were certainly able to hold their own as orchestral
players. Be this as it may, they have certainly, in
modern times, produced some of the finest violinists
the world has seen; the music too, has long since
supplanted that of Italy.</p>
<p>Thomas Baltzar, born at Lubec about 1630, was
esteemed the finest violin performer of his time; but
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
he came to England as we have seen in 1658, and
helped to rescue the violin from the low estimation
in which it was then held, an honour, however, he
only lived five years to enjoy.</p>
<p>It was not until the early part of the eighteenth
century that any attempts were made to establish a
German violin school. Amongst the first to diffuse
any artistic influence may be mentioned Francis
Benda, 1709-86, and John Stamitz, 1719-61, but the
honour of founding a distinct school must be
awarded to Leopold Mozart (father of the great
W. A. Mozart) and after him came William Cramer,
who ultimately came to England; these were followed
by J. Salomon and Kiesewetter.</p>
<p>Louis Spohr, born 1784, may rightly be termed
the founder of the modern German school, he was
both a performer and composer of the highest order.
The names of Guhr, Mayseder and Molique are also
well known as performers of great merit.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Violin making in Germany commenced with the
name of Jacobus Stainer, born at Hall, near Absam,
in the Tyrol, 1621, died 1683. It has been said,
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
though without authority, that he was an apprentice
of Nicholas Amati, a statement which would gain
little credence on comparing the instruments of each
of these makers.</p>
<p>The next makers in succession are the Klotz
family (six in number), 1670-1741. Other makers
will be found in the biographical section.</p>

<br /><span class="small">VIOLIN MAKERS OF THE OLD SCHOOLS.</span></h2>
<h3 id="c5">I.&mdash;ITALIAN.</h3>
<p><span class="ss">ALBANI, MATTHIAS</span>, born at Botzen in
the Tyrol, 1621, died there 1673. He adopted the
Stainer model, and produced some very fine instruments.</p>
<div class="img">

</div>
<p><span class="ss">ALBANI, MATTHIAS</span>, son and pupil of the
foregoing. He afterwards went to Cremona to study
the art in the Amati school, and afterwards adopted
that model with great success.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/ill004a.png" alt="Matthias Albanus mefecit, Bulfani in Tyroli. 1706" width="600" height="118" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p><span class="ss">AMATI, ANDREAS</span>, born about 1520, died
about 1580. Founder of the Cremonese school. It
is conjectured that he was a pupil of Gasparo da
Salo. He adopted rather a small model, built rather
high in the centre. Backs cut on the layers, deep
golden varnish, and perfect finish, are the chief
characteristics of this maker.</p>
<p>The tone is sweet and sympathetic, but lacks brilliancy;
they are therefore valued more on account of
their historical associations than as a musical medium.</p>
<p><span class="ss">AMATI, ANTONIUS</span> and <span class="ss">AMATI,
HIERONYMUS</span>, flourished 1570-1635. These
two were sons of Andreas. They worked together it
is presumed for some time, and produced many instruments
of great beauty. The wood was well
chosen and handsomely figured. The model selected
was not quite so high as that adopted by the father.
The <i>f</i> holes are of beautiful shape, and the backs
are cut variously in the whole or slab. The purfling,
which is of exquisite quality, is inserted with the
utmost skill. The tone of the instruments made by
this ancient firm is sweet and pure, but is deficient in
power.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>

</div>
<p><span class="ss">AMATI, NICOLAS</span>, born 1596, died 1684.
He was the son of Hieronymus, and the best artist of
his family. His first efforts were simply copies of
the firm last mentioned. His most celebrated fiddles
are known as &ldquo;Grand Amati&rsquo;s.&rdquo; He somewhat flattened
the model of his father, and continued the
arching nearer the sides, where it forms a sinking in
round the edges. The <i>f</i> holes are exquisitely cut,
and the corners are long and strongly pronounced.
The wood chosen for the bellies has a fine even
grain, and the backs are beautifully marked. The
varnish used by Nicolas was deeper and richer than
that used by the other members of the family.</p>
<p>The following is a facsimile of an authentic ticket
of this great maker.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>

</div>
<p><span class="ss">BERGONZI, CARLO</span>, Cremona, flourished
1718-47. This maker was the best pupil of Stradivarius.
He at first copied his great master, but subsequently
started a model of his own; rather broad
and heavy, and flat arching. The scroll is strongly
pronounced and finely cut. The <i>f</i> holes, which are
unusually long, are placed low in the body, and very
near the purfling. The wood is carefully selected
and the general workmanship is of superior finish;
only equalled by Nicolas Amati or Stradivarius.
The varnish used by Bergonzi was reddish brown,
rather thickly applied.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p><span class="ss">BERGONZI, MICHAEL ANGELO</span>, Cremona,
1720-60, son of Carlo, made good instruments,
but they certainly suffer on comparison with those of
his father. This maker had two sons called respectively
Nicolaus, and Zosimo, who followed the same
calling from 1739-65.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="ss">CAPPA, GIOFREDO</span>, an early maker who
worked in Cremona about 1590 to 1640. He was a
pupil of Hieronymus and Antonius Amati, when
those brothers were in partnership. In 1640 he proceeded
to Piedmont and founded the school of
Saluzzio, and formed there many good pupils.
Cappa succeeded best in the manufacture of violoncellos.</p>

<p><span class="ss">GAGLIANO, ALLESSANDRO</span>, born about
1640, died at Naples in 1725. He is said to have
commenced operation in Cremona, working under
Stradivarius. His instruments are flat in model,
rather large, and generally of fairly good tone
throughout. Varnish light yellow. The badly cut
scrolls tend to mar the otherwise symmetrical proportions
of this maker&rsquo;s instruments. Label as
follows:</p>
<div class="img">

</div>
<p><span class="ss">GAGLIANO, GENNARO</span>, son of Allessandro,
born about 1695, died 1750. He is considered
the best maker of the family, and his instruments
are, as a consequence, much sought after. He exercised
great care in the selection of his wood, and
used a much finer varnish than either his father or
brother Nicolas. Whether or not he was a prolific
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
maker is uncertain, but instruments of his are rarely
to be met with.</p>

<p><span class="ss">GAGLIANO, NICOLAS</span>, another son of
Allessandro, was born about 1665, died 1740. He
was a finer workman than his father, paying more
attention to the outward appearance of the instrument,
the tone of which is pronounced very fine in
his best examples. Besides violins he made a large
number of violas and violoncellos. His tickets usually
run: &ldquo;Nicolaus Gagliano filius Alexandri fecit
Neap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The remaining members of the family are: Ferdinando,
born 1706, died 1781, eldest son of Nicolas;
Guiseppe, died 1793; Giovanni, died 1806, also
sons of Nicolas; Raffael and Antonio, sons of Giovanni.
Antonio died in 1860. Label of Ferdinando:</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p><span class="ss">GRANCINO, PAOLO</span>, 1665-90, was instructed
by and worked under Nicolas Amati. His
instruments are of large model, light yellow varnish,
large sound-holes, negligent purfling, and carelessly
finished corners. The arching is flattish, and the
scrolls coarse. The tone of his instruments, however,
possess great power and is of good quality. Other
members of the family worked in Milan.</p>
<p><span class="ss">GRANCINO, GIOVANNI BATTISTA</span>, a
good maker of the same school, probably a son of
Paolo. Label as follows:</p>
<div class="img">

</div>
<p><span class="ss">GUADAGNINI, LORENZO</span>, Placentia, 1695-1760.
This maker worked for several years with
Stradivarius, whose instruments he copied with more
or less success. The wood chosen was generally of
fine quality, and the workmanship is evidence that
the maker fabricated his instruments with extreme
care. The tone of a genuine Lorenzo is most brilliant
in the upper register, but somewhat weak in
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
the lower. They are much sought after by performers
where the possession of a Cremona of the
first order is unattainable. The varnish used was a
rich amber or yellowish red of fine quality. A ticket
of this maker is as follows:</p>

<p><span class="ss">GUADAGNINI, GIOVANNI BATTISTA</span>,
was a brother of Lorenzo. He made some really
good instruments, dividing his attention between the
Stradivari and the Amati models. Giambattista
was a son of Lorenzo, and reputed pupil of Stradivarius.
He afterwards went to Piacenza and subsequently
settled in Turin. His instruments are also
much prized. Guiseppe, son of Giovanni, worked
successively in Milan, Como and Parma. Other
members of the same family also made violins, but
little appears to be known of them or of their works.</p>

<p><span class="ss">GUARNERIUS, ANDREAS</span>, born about
1626, died 1698.</p>
<p>The founder of this celebrated family of violin
makers was a pupil of Nicolas Amati. His instruments
are estimable for good workmanship somewhat
in the style of the Amati, although marked by
certain peculiar details, by which indeed they are
recognised. His varnish is either golden yellow or
brownish red. Andreas left two sons, Peter and
Joseph.</p>

<p><span class="ss">GUARNERIUS, GIUSEPPE</span>, usually called
&ldquo;Joseph,&rdquo; son of Andreas, born 1666, died about
1739. Although he may have been a pupil of Andreas,
he has not followed his model. Some say he
followed Stradivarius, whose contemporary he was,
and subsequently followed his cousin, also called
Joseph, of whom we shall speak presently. He has
consequently varied both in his patterns and in the
details of manufacture; but his instruments are of
good quality and much esteemed, and are more elegant
in form than those of his father. The colour
of his varnish is a brilliant red.</p>

<p>Most authorities agree in dividing his working
career into four periods. His first attempts were not
marked by any characteristic sign of originality, except
in the indifferent choice of material, form and
in the varnish. In the second period, his instruments
are found to be made with care; the wood used for
the sides and back being of excellent quality, and
cut on the quarter (<i>sur maille</i>); the deal of the belly
has been well chosen; the varnish of fine complexion
and elastic quality. The pattern is small, but of
beautiful outline. The arching is slightly elevated
and falls off towards the purfling in a graceful
curve. M. F&eacute;tis in his criticism of these instruments,
points out an obvious defect, namely, the too great
thickness of the wood, especially in the backs, which
tends to impede the freedom of vibration, and consequently
the brilliance of sound. In the third or
grand period of his career, Joseph Guarnerius, says
the same authority, presents a still more surprising
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
variety in the forms of his instruments. During this
period he produced instruments of large pattern,
made of excellent wood cut (<i>sur maille</i>); and conformably
to the best conditions possible, in respect
to arching and degrees of thickness. A beautiful
varnish of a lovely orange shade, remarkable for its
fineness and elasticity, protect these excellent instruments,
which are considered equal to the most
beautiful productions of Anthony Stradivarius. We
now arrive at the fourth period, which, it is sad to
observe, forms a striking contrast to the glorious
third. Here we have evidence of a lamentable falling
off. The master seems to have worked carelessly,
the wood is poor, as is the varnish.</p>
<p>Reports have been handed down to account for
this apparent degeneration of talent, but as it is impossible
to verify the same, it can serve no good purpose
to here relate them. It only remains to be said,
concerning this great master, that he has built up a
reputation that is not likely to suffer by mere rumour.</p>
<p>Paganini possessed one of the finest examples of
a del Jes&ugrave;, which was presented to him by a M. Livron,
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
a French merchant of Leghorn. At his death,
27th May, 1840, Paganini bequeathed it to his native
town, Genoa, where it is preserved in a glass case in
the museum.</p>

<p><span class="ss">GUARNERIUS, PIETRO</span>, Cremona, eldest
son of Andreas, born 1655, and lived to an advanced
age. His first productions, which are of flat model,
are dated from Cremona, but later on he established
himself at Mantua, where he manufactured a great
quantity of instruments of undoubted merit, but
have the fault of too high an arching, and some
there are wanting in brilliancy of tone. His tickets
usually run:</p>

<p>This maker had a nephew also called Pietro, who
worked at Mantua from about 1725 to 1740, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
subsequently in Venice till about 1755. He was a
pupil of his uncle, but his work is less esteemed.</p>
<p><span class="ss">LANDOLPHUS, CARLO</span>, Milan, 1750-1775,
reputed pupil of Guarnerius. This maker was
decidedly original in his pattern. Although his instruments
are not characteristic of great beauty as
regards outline, they possess a very pleasing tone.
He is one of the last of the old Italian school, consequently
his instruments are rapidly increasing in
value. The most striking point observable in his
work is the extremely weak and small scroll. He
left a number of instruments unpurfled and otherwise
in an unfinished state. Those with the light
red varnish are considered the best. He also made
some violoncellos of small size. Ticket:</p>

</div>
<p><span class="ss">MAGGINI, GIOVANNI PAOLO</span>, born
1580, died about 1640. This distinguished maker is
the second representative of the Brescian school,
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
and reputed pupil of Gasparo da Salo. According
to recent researches, Maggini was born in Botticino
Sera, a small village not far from Brescia.</p>
<p>Maggini&rsquo;s instruments are in general of large
pattern; their proportions are similar to those of
Gasparo da Salo, and the style of workmanship
almost identical. The swell or arching is decided,
and reaches almost to the edges. The sides or ribs
are narrow; the bellies very strong and of good
quality, the backs generally thin, with the wood cut
on the layers. The varnish, which is remarkable for
its delicacy, is of a yellowish light brown colour;
sometimes, however, he used a brownish red varnish.
In either case it is of excellent quality. The extended
dimensions, and the proportion of the arching
relative to the various thicknesses of the wood, impart
to most of these instruments a superb, grave
and melancholy tone.</p>
<p>Another characteristic of this master&rsquo;s productions
is found in his ornamentation. He generally
affected a double row of purfling and various other
decorations, and although Maggini was not alone in
this respect, he appears to be the last maker who
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
relinquished the practice of introducing any ornate
addition, which, anterior to his period, was considered
so essential to the finish of an instrument.</p>
<p>Maggini is credited with being the first maker who
paid any real attention to the inside of the instrument,
having, it is said, introduced the side linings
and corner blocks, which have ever since been a <i>sine
qua non</i> of construction.</p>
<p>De Beriot, the great violinist, was an admirer of
Maggini&rsquo;s violins.</p>

Venice, 1700-1740. He was probably a pupil of
Nicolas Amati, whose model he at first copied, but
subsequently modified this for one of his own, of a
somewhat large pattern. The scroll is larger and
more powerful than that of his reputed master and
in the sound holes he also differs. As regards the
arching and outline, the Amati type is at once
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
apparent. The varnish is superb, and of golden
brown transparency. The wood chosen is always the
very finest, and the workmanship is all that can be
desired. He also made some very fine violoncellos.
His best instruments, which are of great rarity, are
dated from Venice.</p>

maker of whom any reliable record is extant. He is
said to have been born at Salo in Lombardy, and
afterwards to have settled in Brescia. Gasparo is
generally credited with the honour of inventing or
producing violins in their present shape. He seems
to have devoted his early period to the manufacture
of lutes and viols, and subsequently to have turned
his attention to the violin, which he greatly improved,
thereby founding the Brescian school of violin
makers; the earliest known. The violins of Gasparo
which have now become very scarce, do not, it is true,
exhibit that indication of finish so observable in the
instruments produced by his reputed pupil, Maggini,
but his model is excellent and the tone good, being
somewhat analogous to that of the tenor. The fact
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
that Gasparo never dated his labels, makes it difficult
to determine with certainty the exact period of
his activity.</p>

sometimes copied Joseph &ldquo;del Jes&ugrave;,&rdquo; at others, he
followed his own originality. His instruments exhibit
great variation; notably in the position of the
sound holes, which he never placed twice alike. He
used a poor varnish which clearly indicates the
change of process which was then taking place.
Although these instruments are far from being
graceful in outline or beautiful in appearance, they
are capable of producing a good tone; in fact, in
Italy a good Storioni is highly spoken of. This
maker does not appear to have made many violas or
violoncellos. Ticket:</p>

<p><span class="ss">STRADIVARIUS, ANTONIO</span>, the king of
fiddle makers, born at Cremona, 1644, died 1737.
This great master was an apprentice in the workshop
of Nicolas Amati. At the age of twenty-three years
he produced some violins, the exact reproductions of
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
his master, and into which it is said he placed the
labels of Nicolas. In the year 1670 he signed his
instruments with his own name. From that date,
until about 1690, he produced but few instruments,
and it is conjectured, that during this period of
twenty years, his labours and researches were more
in the nature of experiments than of commercial
enterprise.</p>
<p>From the year 1690 the individuality of Stradivarius
began to assert itself. It was then that he
began to give greater amplitude to his model. He
reduced the high arching hitherto prevailing, and
determined with much nicety the various thicknesses
of wood, but he still retained many of the chief
characteristics of his master. The productions of
this period are called &ldquo;Long Strads.&rdquo; From 1700
to 1725 Stradivarius was in the full lustre of his
fame. During this period he made those masterpieces
known as the &ldquo;Grand Pattern.&rdquo; &ldquo;He no
longer felt his way, but being certain of all that he
did, he carried his manufacture, even to the minutest
details, to the highest possible finish, especially with
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
regard to the varnish, the quality of which is fine
and extremely supple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The workmanship of the interior of the instrument
displays no less perfection; all is there finished
with the greatest care. The degrees of thickness are
adjusted in a rational manner, and are remarkable
for a precision which could not have been attained
except by long study and experiment. The back,
the belly, and all the parts of which the instrument
is composed, are in a perfectly harmonious relation.
It was, doubtless, repeated trials and diligent observations,
which also led Stradivarius, throughout
this period of his productive career, to make the
blocks and sides of his violins of willow, the specific
lightness of which surpasses that of every other
wood. In short, everything had been foreseen, calculated,
and determined with certainty, in these admirable
instruments. The bar alone is too weak, in
consequence of the gradual rise in the pitch, from
the beginning of the eighteenth century; the inevitable
result of which has been a considerable increase
of tension, and a much greater pressure exercised on
the belly. Hence the necessity has arisen for re-barring
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
all the old violins and violoncellos.&rdquo; Such
is F&eacute;tis&rsquo;s description of this grand period.</p>
<p>From 1725 to 1730, Stradivarius produced fewer
instruments than he had previously done in the same
period of time. Although they are very good, the
workmanship no longer displays the same perfection.
The arching becomes more rounded, which
tends to impair the clearness of the sound, and the
varnish is brown.</p>
<p>After the year 1730, the master exhibits a decided
falling off. Stradivarius, in his eighty-sixth year,
still, however, continued at his bench, assisted by his
two sons, Omobono and Francisco, and his pupil,
Carlo Bergonzi, who partially, if not wholly, kept
the business going. Stradivarius signed many of his
instruments as having been made simply under his
direction. After the death of this great maker, many
instruments which remained unfinished in his workshop
were completed by his sons. Most of these instruments
bear the father&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>Stradivarius died at the great age of ninety-three
years, and he was buried in the Cathedral of
Cremona.</p>

fault that the three upper strings improve greatly
by being played on, but the G string, in most of
them, remains so far inferior, that while the tone of

good violins on the model of the Cremonese, and
displayed, in his beautiful and excellent workmanship,

produce a very weak squally tone, when they have
been carelessly repaired; though even in this case
they may be often restored and brought nearly to

an experienced maker, possessing a knowledge of
mathematics and acoustics, without which they will

When young he quitted his native village and placed
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
himself under Stainer at Absam. Having learnt the
art under this celebrated maker, he returned to his
native place and set up in business on his own account,
and soon gained considerable renown as a
maker of superior instruments, so much so that his
productions for some time almost eclipsed those of
his master. Even now a sound specimen&mdash;which is
rarely seen, is not lightly passed over. His instruments
possess a fine and powerful tone.</p>
<p><span class="ss">KLOTZ, MATHIAS</span>, 1653-1745. Worked for
about twenty years in Mittenwald, during which
period he produced instruments of an unsatisfactory
nature. He appears to have been aware of this, and
with the object of increasing his knowledge, he
undertook a journey to Florence and Cremona and
other centres of violin industry. With his newly-acquired
experience he returned to his native place
and established himself in rather a large way.</p>
<p><span class="ss">KLOTZ, SEBASTIAN</span>, son of Mathias
(1700-1760). The instruments of this maker are a
decided improvement, both as regards pattern and

<p><span class="ss">STAINER, JACOBUS</span>, born at Hall, near
Absam&mdash;a short distance from Innsbruck&mdash;July 14,
1621, died at Absam, 1683. This maker is the most
renowned of the German school, concerning whose
early career the following account has been handed
down. A priest residing in the district of Absam took
a fancy to young Jacob, and had him sent to Innsbruck
to learn the art of organ building under one Daniel
Herz. This calling not suiting the youth&rsquo;s inclinations,
his master advised him to learn the art of
violin making. Stainer then went to Cremona, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
placed himself under Nicolas Amati, who soon recognised
the talent of his young pupil, and took
great pains in instructing him in the secrets of the
art. He then quitted Cremona, and for a short time
worked in Venice under Vermercati, who at that time
was a maker of some merit. With an accumulation
of experience gained in the best schools of
the time, Stainer finally returned to Absam and
settled there as a maker of violins on his own account.
In the year 1645 he married a Margaretha
Holzhammer, by whom he had several children. His
renown as a violin maker rapidly increased, but for
some reason or other he found it difficult to provide
for the wants of himself and family, and he was
compelled to travel about the country in order to
dispose of his instruments. However, in 1658, he
was appointed court violin maker to the Archduke
Leopold, and in 1669 received the distinction of
&ldquo;Maker to the Emperor&rdquo;; but all these advantages
and honours contributed but little to raise him from
his chronic state of poverty. He now began to experience
some bitter reverses. A certain creditor of
his, named Solomon Heubnar, with whom he at one
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
time lived (Stainer left him without paying for his
board) lodged an information against him charging
him with the crime of heresy. He was seized and
thrown into prison, and remained there six months,
at the expiration of which he found himself utterly
ruined and poverty stared him in the face. He was
then persecuted by Count Albert Fugger for certain
dues which it was customary to levy on court tradesmen.
Stainer petitioned the Emperor to waive this
claim, but to no purpose, his supplication being ignored,
it is thought, in consequence of his previous
conviction for the alleged heresy. Stainer then fell
into a state of abject misery, neglected his work,
and finally died out of mind. It will therefore be
seen that this renowned maker worked under most
distressing conditions, and it is a marvel that he was
able to produce anything worthy of subsequent
copying. Stainer&rsquo;s house is still pointed out, and,
it is said, the bench to which he was bound
when mad.</p>
<p>Another story which has gained currency in some
quarters, but in others said to be mythical, recounts
that at the latter period of his life he abandoned
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
his calling and became an inmate of a Benedictine
monastery. Here, with the assistance of a brother
monk, he contrived to get together sufficient materials
for the manufacture of sixteen violins of great
beauty. These apparently fabulous fiddles are
known as the &ldquo;Elector&rdquo; Stainers from the circumstance
that each Elector was supposed to be the recipient
of one of these instruments, the remaining
going to the Emperor of Germany. For information
concerning the instruments made by this
unfortunate fiddle maker, the best is that contained
in the treatise of Jacob Augustus Otto, maker to the
Court of the Archduke of Weimar, translated from
the German by Thomas Fardely, of Leeds (1833),
and since then by the late Mr. Bishop, of Cheltenham
(William Reeves, London).</p>
<p>Otto says: &ldquo;The instruments made by Jacob
Stainer differ from the Cremonese both in outward
shape and in tone. They are higher modelled, and
their proportions of strength are calculated quite
differently. The nearest comparison which can be
drawn between a Cremonese and a Stainer is this:
a Cremonese has a strong reedy, sonorous tone
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
something similar to that of a clarionet, while a
Stainer approaches to that of a flute. The belly is
modelled higher than the back. The highest part
of the model under the bridge extends exactly one
half of the instrument towards the lower broad part
and then diminishes towards the end edge. It decreases
in a like manner at the upper broad part
towards the neck. The breadth of this model is uniformly
the same as that of the bridge, from which
it diminishes towards the side edge. The edges are
very strong and round. The purfling lies somewhat
nearer to the edges than in the Cremonese, and is
likewise narrower than in the latter (the Cremonese)
in which it is very broad. The <i>f</i> holes in Stainer
instruments are very beautifully cut, and the upper
and under turns are perfectly circular. In length
they are somewhat shorter than the Cremonese. The
neck is particularly handsome, and the scroll is as
round and smooth as if it had been turned. Some
few have lions&rsquo; heads, which are extremely well
carved. The sides and the back are made of the
finest figured maple and covered with a deep yellow
amber varnish. In some the screw (peg) box is
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
varnished dark brown and the belly deep yellow.
The above are the most accurate marks by which the
genuine Stainer instruments may be distinguished.
They are rarely to be found with any labels inside,
but in the few which are to be met with of the genuine
instruments bearing any inscription, they are
simply written, not printed. In the Tyrolese imitations
of Stainers they are all printed. In the
genuine Cremonese instruments they are likewise invariably
printed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Genuine Stainers with labels have this written inscription:
&ldquo;Jacobus Stainer in Absam prope &OElig;nipontum
h-fis 165-.&rdquo; The following is a facsimile:</p>

<h3 id="c7">III.&mdash;FRENCH.</h3>
<p><span class="ss">BOQUAY, JACQUES.</span> Paris, about 1700-1735.
One of the earliest of the old French school.
Under whom he learnt the art of violin making is
not known, but his instruments, as also those of his
contemporaries, clearly indicate that the Italian influence
was suffusing itself in no uncertain manner.
It appears that about the middle of the sixteenth
century, one Nicolas R&eacute;nault, a French viol and
lute maker, travelled into Italy and became associated
with Andreas Amati, and even assisted that
maker in the manufacture of certain instruments for
the chapel of Charles IX, in 1566, and, after a somewhat
lengthened stay in Italy, he returned to France
the gainer of considerable experience. Here, perhaps,
may be the explanation why Boquay and the
rest of the early French school principally adhered
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
to the Amati model. Later on Boquay sought to
become original, notably with regard to the sound
holes and the scroll. The tone is sweet, but lacks
power.</p>
<div class="img">

</div>
<p><span class="ss">COMBLE, AMBROISE DE</span>, Tourney,
Belgium (1730-1760). The best maker of the old
French school, and reputed pupil of Stradivarius.
Although the instruments of de Comble cannot be said
to be on the model adopted by the great Cremonese
maker during his best period, there is nevertheless some
indication to lead to the belief that he endeavoured
to follow the renowned artist in the matter of varnish.
In this respect he was fairly successful. His instruments
are rather flat and of large pattern, somewhat
on the lines of Stradivarius&rsquo;s later productions, and
although they are not characteristic of refined workmanship,
the material chosen was of the best quality.
He made his instruments strong in the wood, consequently
they possess a very full and rich tone. De
Comble also made some excellent violoncellos.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p><span class="ss">LUPOT, NICOLAS</span>, born at Stuttgart, 1758,
died in Paris, 1824, founder of the modern school
of violin making. His father, also a maker of some
merit, removed to Orl&eacute;ans in the year 1770, and in
this town instructed his son in the art which was
destined to make his name famous. During his
pupilage Nicolas set himself to study the instruments
of the great Italian makers, especially those
of Stradivarius, and in the result he elected to adopt
the model of this master, from which he seldom, if
ever, departed. With such diligence and enthusiasm
did he labour to produce something akin to his ideal
that he soon was able to turn out an instrument
that suffered but little on comparison with the
Italians of the first water. Thus a most beneficial
influence in the art of violin making became propagated.
In 1798 Nicolas quitted Orl&eacute;ans for Paris
and established himself in business, and there for
twenty-six years he carried on a labour of love
which, as well, produced considerable pecuniary
benefits. Lupot had not been long in Paris before
his work claimed the attention of the Conservatoire,
then but recently formed, and he was accordingly
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
appointed violin maker to that excellent institution:
he was similarly appointed to the Chapel Royal. It
is not difficult to imagine that Lupot endeavoured
to revive the lost art of making the old Italian
varnish, judging from the various qualities with
which he was wont to cover his instruments. In this
respect, however, he cannot be said to have been successful,
but what he did use ranks high as a modern
varnish. The instruments of this maker are highly
prized, especially those made between 1805 and 1824.
An impetus was probably given to the value of
Lupot&rsquo;s violins from the circumstance that the celebrated
Spohr played for a long time on a Lupot,
the tone of which he declared was &ldquo;full and powerful&rdquo;;
in fact, the great virtuoso only parted with
this instrument on becoming possessed of a Strad.
Lupot appears to have been almost as uncertain
about his labels as he was concerning his varnish.
At Orl&eacute;ans he adopted a Latinised inscription, and
in Paris, three labels have been noticed variously
worded. The following are copies of some
labels:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>N. Lupot fils, Luthier, rue d&rsquo;Illiers, &agrave; Orl&eacute;ans,
l&rsquo;an 17&mdash;.</p>
<p>Nicholas Lupot, Luthier, rue de Grammont, &agrave; Paris,
l&rsquo;an 17&mdash;.</p>
<p>Nicholas Lupot, rue Croix des petits champs, &agrave;
Paris, l&rsquo;an 1817.</p>
<p>Nicholas had a brother named Fran&ccedil;ois, who became
celebrated as a maker of bows.</p>
<p><span class="ss">VUILLAUME, JOHN BAPTISTE</span>, born at
Mirecourt, October 7, 1798, died February 19, 1875;
the greatest violin maker and copier of modern
times. It is not precisely known under whom he
received his first instruction in the art of violin
making. Some say his father, one Claude Vuillaume,
born at Mirecourt in 1771, died 1834, whilst
others maintain that the father was not a fiddle
maker, but a carrier between Mirecourt and Nancy.
At all events, at the age of nineteen, he was engaged
by Fran&ccedil;ois Chanot, a violin maker of repute, who
had just about that period established a workshop
for the manufacture of a new-shaped violin, which
had been patented, so it is not unlikely that Fran&ccedil;ois
Chanot was his first real master. He next engaged
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
himself with one L&eacute;t&eacute;, an organ builder, who
dealt in violins, and ultimately became a partner in
the concern. In 1828 he parted from L&eacute;t&eacute; and continued
in business alone. During this period he
found great difficulty in disposing of his instruments;
the rage being for those of Italian manufacture.
He thereupon took to fabricating copies of
the old masters, and his operations in this line appear
to have been attended with great success. As
a large number of old instruments, Italian and
others, passed through his hands for repair, Vuillaume
had ample opportunity afforded him for
studying and ascertaining the inward and outward
conditions necessary for the production of good
tone, and this advantage he was not slow to avail
himself of. Fortified with a vast amount of experience,
combined with much knowledge gained by experiment,
Vuillaume was in course of time enabled
to produce an instrument in all but one point equal
to the greatest Italian masters, the condition wanting
being that of age. In some cases, possibly
through stress of trade, Vuillaume endeavoured to
supply this deficiency by giving to his instruments
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
an appearance of wear and long usage. In his
latter years, however, he relinquished this pernicious
practice. The climax of his skill as a copyist was
reached on the occasion when he reproduced a facsimile
of Paganini&rsquo;s famous Guarnerius, entrusted
for repair. This copy was so marvellous in its similarity
with the original, both as regards appearance
and tone, that the great virtuoso himself failed to
recognise his own instrument, and Vuillaume had to
point it out to him. In addition to his high capabilities
as a violin maker, Vuillaume was renowned as
a bow maker, and effected some improvements in that
important adjunct, and on the whole proved himself
a genius of uncommon order.</p>

<p><span class="ss">WILLIAM ADDISON&mdash;THOMAS COLE&mdash;EDWARD PAMPHILON&mdash;PEMBERTON&mdash;THOMAS URQUHART&mdash;CHRISTOPHER WISE.</span></p>
<p>This group represents the early English school
and the principal makers existing during the seventeenth
century. It may reasonably be inferred that
they were more at home with the viol than with the
violin as known to-day. Little can be said concerning
their early productions, as they are now all but
extinct; a great portion of them probably perished in
the great fire of London in 1666, in which city some
of them were supposed to have worked.</p>
<p>Christopher Wise is said to have made some fairly
good instruments of a highly decorative nature.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>Jacob Rayman was the better artist, and some instruments
attributed to him reflect great credit on
this early school.</p>
<p>Thomas Urquhart was a still further advance, his
outline and varnish places him in the front rank of
the period.</p>
<p>Edward Pamphilon made instruments of a very
tubby appearance, but they are said to possess a clear
and penetrating tone; age, too, has imparted a very
rich colouring to the varnish.</p>
<p>Several other names have been handed down, but
as they are minus the instruments, nothing of importance
can be said on the subject.</p>
<p>Aldred and Bolles are mentioned in Mace&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Musick&rsquo;s Monument.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="ss">ADDISON, WILLIAM</span>, was a maker of viols
and early violins in the middle of the seventeenth
century. He worked in Moorfields, London.</p>
<p><span class="ss">AIRETON, EDMUND.</span> A London maker
about the middle of the eighteenth century. He
copied successively the instruments of Stainer, Amati
and Stradivarius, but those on the Amati model are
most admired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p><span class="ss">BANKS FAMILY.</span> They rank among the best
makers of English violins, and genuine specimens
are eagerly sought after and realise good
prices.</p>
<p><span class="ss">BANKS, BENJAMIN.</span> Born July 14, 1727,
died February 18, 1795. Accounts differ as to the
place of his birth, but as his parents were living in
Salisbury in the year 1725, it is generally supposed
he was born in that town.</p>
<p>Banks has been justly termed &ldquo;the English
Amati,&rdquo; and this comparison is well deserved. His
fiddles are faithful copies of the great Italian, both
as to model and varnish. These instruments are,
however, very rare, and fiddles of this model offered
as genuine Benjamins should only be purchased with
the advice of experts.</p>
<p>Benjamin also made instruments for the then well-known
music-firm of Longman and Broderip in
London. These were made on a different model,
somewhat after the Stainer model, and they are
greatly inferior to his favourite Amati fiddles, the
finish and varnish indicate hurry and carelessness.
These fiddles are labelled with the name of the firm
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
for whom he worked. I have seen many fiddles
bearing the name of Longman and Broderip and
said to have been made by Benjamin Banks. The
majority of them are, however, spurious. It has
been the custom of many dealers to cut off the name
of Longman and Broderip from the bottom of the
published music of that firm and insert these in
fiddles, and as Benjamin Banks was known to have
worked for them, some show of genuineness is
thereby implied.</p>
<p>Banks made a number of violas and violoncellos.
The latter instruments stand pre-eminent for workmanship
and tone and are particularly well adapted
for the performance of solo and chamber music.
This maker adopted a variety of methods for stamping
and otherwise labelling his instruments. Below
the button was the favourite place.</p>
<p>The labels mostly seen are:</p>
<p>Made by Benjamin Banks, Catherine Street,
Salisbury.</p>
<p>Benjamin Banks, fecit Salisbury.</p>
<p>Benjamin Banks, Musical Instrument Maker, In
Catherine Street, Salisbury.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>B. Banks, Sarum. &ldquo;B. B.&rdquo; stamped under the
button.</p>
<p>The varnish used by Banks varied from a deep
red to a yellow brown.</p>
<p>One word of advice, beware of the unredeemed
pledge.</p>
<p><span class="ss">BANKS, BENJAMIN.</span> Son of the preceding;
born at Salisbury, 1754, died in Liverpool,
1820. He worked at first for his renowned father,
afterwards removing to London, where, possibly, he
assisted in making the Longman and Broderip instruments.
He then went to Liverpool and worked
there until his death. Very little is known of him
or his works, though it is possible that many of his
instruments have been passed off as the work of his
father.</p>
<p><span class="ss">BANKS, JAMES</span> and <span class="ss">HENRY</span>, two other
sons of the great Benjamin, and successors to the
business at Salisbury, where they were both born,
James about 1756, died 1831; Henry, 1770, died
1830.</p>
<p>James was the violin maker of the concern, while
Henry devoted himself to tuning pianofortes and
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
repairing instruments. Sometimes, however, they
collaborated in the production of violins and violoncellos.
They also extended the sphere of their operations
to music selling and dealt in other musical
instruments. The fame of the Banks family as
violin makers declined at this period.</p>
<p><span class="ss">BARRETT, JOHN.</span> A London maker, who
worked about 1725. He made some good instruments
which are dated from the Harp and Crown in
Piccadilly. He followed the Stainer model. His
varnish is unsatisfactory.</p>
<p><span class="ss">BETTS, JOHN</span>, London, born at Stamford in
1755, died 1823. This excellent maker was a pupil
of Duke, and adopted the Amati model. He was
not himself a prolific maker, his time being principally
occupied in the study of old Italian instruments,
the result of which enabled him to become a
very successful dealer and connoisseur. Betts, or
&ldquo;old John,&rdquo; as he was most commonly called, carried
on an extensive business in the construction of
violins, and employed in his workshop such men as
John Carter, Edward Betts, Panormo, Bernhard
Fendt, all of whom subsequently succeeded in
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
making good instruments on their own account.
Betts&rsquo;s shop was No. 2 near Northgate of the Royal
Exchange, and after his death the business was continued
by his descendants till within a few years
ago.</p>
<p><span class="ss">DUKE, RICHARD</span>, London, about 1765-1791.
Probably no violin of English make has attained
such popularity as have the instruments of this
maker, hence it is that he is so extensively imitated.
Who instructed him in the art of making violins,
etc., is not positively known, but his instruments are
of the highest order in all respects but the varnish,
in which he was not always successful. Duke followed
both the Stainer and Amati models, the latter
being his best. His violoncellos are rather high in
model, long in pattern, yellowish varnish and rich
in tone. For his violins he used a dull brown varnish,
very elastic and transparent. During a considerable
period Duke worked in the vicinity of
Holborn. Many of his instruments are stamped near
the button &ldquo;Duke, London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Labels, mostly written in pen and ink, are as
follows:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>Richd. Duke, Londini, fecit 1767.</p>
<p>Richard Duke, Maker, Holborn, London, Anno
1777.</p>
<p>The following is a copy of a printed one:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Richard Duke, Maker, near opposite Great Turn-Stile,
Holbourn, London.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="ss">FENDT, BERNHARD</span>, born at Inspruck, in
the Tyrol, in 1756, died in London in 1832. He was
at first instructed in the art of violin making by his
uncle in Paris, who spelt his name Fent, a maker
there of some reputation. Bernhard then came to
London and entered the service of Thomas Dodd,
the bow maker, and remained with him several years,
working in conjunction with John Frederick Lott.
They were never entrusted to carry their work
beyond the white, and the instruments turned out by
this pair were delivered to their master, who applied
the varnish with his own hand, the secret of which
he kept carefully to himself.</p>
<p><span class="ss">FORSTER, WILLIAM</span>, known as &ldquo;Old&rdquo;
Forster, born at Brampton, Cumberland, May,
1739, died in London, December 14, 1808. The
name of Forster in connection with violin making
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
includes a family whose operation extended over
a very considerable period, but the artist under
notice was <i>the</i> fiddle maker of the group, and
his instruments to-day reflect great credit on the
British school of a century ago; indeed his instruments,
whether they be violins, violas or violoncellos,
are pre-eminent amongst the productions of this
country. His father pursued two occupations, viz.,
that of spinning-wheel maker and violin maker and
repairer; instructions in which handicrafts were
duly imparted to the son, who also became
tolerably proficient as a violinist. In consequence
of some family differences, the young man quitted
his native village and proceeded to London, arriving
there in 1759. His first endeavours in the
metropolis were unsuccessful, and he was forced to
accept some employment offered him by a gun-stock
maker. However, he did not forsake the art he
loved, and his spare time was occupied in making
violins, which he disposed of to the music shops.
During this time he suffered great hardship and
privation, the effects of which were never afterwards
entirely eradicated. At length he obtained employment
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
as a violin maker at a music shop on Tower
Hill kept by one Beck, and the violins he made
during his two years&rsquo; engagement there, gaining
much recognition, he not unnaturally demanded an
advance in wages. This was refused, and Forster
consequently left him. In 1762 he commenced business
on his own account at a house in Duke&rsquo;s Court,
and there his artistic abilities procured for him the
attention and patronage of the musical dilettanti.
He then moved into St. Martin&rsquo;s Lane, and added
music publishing and selling to his business, and at
this period he was wont to cut his name from the
title-pages of his soiled or unsold music and use it
as a ticket for his instruments. In 1781 he entered
into negotiations with Haydn for the supply and
publication of certain pieces of music for the string
family, which resulted, it would appear, in a great
success all round. About 1784, Forster opened in
the Strand&mdash;No. 348, and here the climax of his success
was attained, even to the extent of receiving
Royal patronage. From the year 1762 to 1770 he
adopted the Stainer model, and applied to his instruments
some sort of dark stain, completing the
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
operation with a coat of varnish. From 1770 or
thereabouts he affected the Amati pattern with
greater success, and this refers particularly to his
violoncellos, as they are really grand instruments,
better varnish is used and greater attention is paid
to detail. Robert Lindley, the famous violoncellist,
used one of Forster&rsquo;s instruments at the Italian Opera
for nearly forty years; he named it &ldquo;The Eclipse.&rdquo;
Crossdill had a famous one, and Cervette the
younger had another. Only four double basses are
known to have been made by William Forster. His
commoner instruments are devoid of purfling.

<p><span class="ss">FORSTER, WILLIAM</span>, son of &ldquo;Old&rdquo; Forster.

and repairer of some merit, but never attained the

unpurfled.</p>
<p><span class="ss">KENNEDY, ALEXANDER</span>, came from Scotland
about 1700 and established himself in London,
He was a painstaking workman, and gained a good
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
reputation. He followed the Stainer model and
used a light amber varnish.</p>
<p><span class="ss">KENNEDY, JOHN</span>, nephew and pupil of the
foregoing, followed the same model, and produced
some good violins and tenors.</p>
<p><span class="ss">KENNEDY, THOMAS</span>, the best known of
the family. He made a large number of violins and
&rsquo;cellos.</p>
<p><span class="ss">NORMAN, BARAK</span> (1688-1740). He was
chiefly a maker of viols, but has made violas and
violoncellos, and a few violins on the Stainer model;
his best productions being copies of Maggini. He
was probably a pupil of Urquhart, if one may judge
from their respective works. As a maker of viols
he was much esteemed in his day; all his instruments
of this class indicate careful workmanship.
As no British violoncello has been discovered anterior
to those manufactured by Norman, it is
thought that he may have been the first maker of
that instrument in this country. They are splendid
instruments and much valued. His violas also are
fine specimens, and consequently highly prized by
performers on that instrument. Between the years
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
1715 and 1720 Barak Norman entered into partnership
with one Nathaniel Cross, at the sign of the
&ldquo;Bass Viol,&rdquo; St. Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard. Barak resorted
to various methods in order to distinguish his instruments,
sometimes his monogram is purfled in the
centre of the back, and occasionally, in the case
of violoncellos, on the top table under the wide
part of the finger-board. When he became associated
with Cross, the joint monogram was used.
The following is a copy of a printed label used by
the firm:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barak Norman and Nathaniel Cross, at the Bass
Viol in St. Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard, London, fecit 172&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="ss">WAMSLEY, PETER</span>, London (1727-1760).
He was at one time considered a clever maker of
violas and violoncellos, but having resorted to the
unfortunate practice of thinning the wood in his
endeavour to secure a freer tone, his instruments at
the present day lack power and sonority. They are,
however, capable of great improvement in the hands
of a skilful repairer. He adopted the Stainer model,
and at times proved himself to be a first-class workman.
Most of his instruments have only ink lines
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
instead of purfling. Wamsley made a few double
basses, but they are now very scarce. The best instruments
of this maker are those covered with a
dark brown varnish. For a great number of years
Wamsley carried on business in Piccadilly, and used
labels, copies of which are as follows:</p>

<br />ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLASSICAL MUSIC FOR THE VIOLIN AND OTHER STRINGED INSTRUMENTS.</h2>

against which the destroying hand of time

for the instrument, and the musicians of the
time vied with each other in producing works calculated
to raise the violin from its hitherto subordinate
rank as a mere accompanist to its proper
position as a solo instrument, thereby ensuring prominence
and with it rapid popularity.</p>
<p>It is to Italy that we have to turn for any certain
knowledge of the earliest classics, and the
first to claim our attention is Arcangelo Corelli
(1655-1713). He was not only the founder of
the Roman school, the earliest known, but probably
the first to definitely fix the form of the
sonata. In those times two kinds of sonatas were
recognised, called respectively, <i>sonate da camera</i>,
i.e., chamber sonata, and <i>sonata da chiesa</i>, or church
sonata. The first-named consisted of a series of
dance measures (allemande, courante, saraband,
gigues, etc.), systematically arranged, whilst the
latter was a subject treated in fugal and other
learned styles, and otherwise rendered more in keeping
with the dignity of the place in which such
compositions were performed. In the time of Corelli,
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
the sonata usually commenced with an <i>adagio</i>,
and after two or three other movements finished with
an <i>allegro</i> or <i>presto</i>.</p>
<p>Corelli as a composer showed a great partiality
for this class of music, and his compositions rapidly
spread throughout the length and breadth of
Europe. Tartini caused all his pupils to study the
works of Corelli. There is not, it is true, evidence
of a great amount of musical erudition, but what
has conferred a remarkable longevity on his works
is his melodic simplicity and pure harmony. His
works are forty-eight sonatas for two violins and
bass (Op. 1-4), produced 1683-94; twelve sonatas for
violin and bass (Op. 5), 1700; twelve &ldquo;concerti-grossi,&rdquo;
for two violins and &rsquo;cello as principal instruments,
and two violins, viola and bass as accompanying
instruments.</p>
<p>Such a gifted musician as Corelli was not likely
to quit this life without leaving the impress of his
artistic feelings upon those who sought his instruction,
and we have ample proof of the great influence
he exerted in the names of G. B. Somis (1676-1763)
F. Geminiani (1680-1762), and Locatelli (1693-1764).
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
Somis was a close follower of his master, and it is
quite easy to believe this on a comparison of their
respective sonatas. Geminiani asserted more of his
individuality, and this, coupled with the fact of his
having received theoretical instruction from Alessandro
Scarlatti, one of the most learned musicians of
the day, no doubt contributed to his making a decided
advance on the violin music of the time. Notwithstanding
his increased knowledge as a theorist,
and his greater ability as an executant, Geminiani
laboured long to bring into prominence and popularity
the artistic conceptions of his renowned violin
master. His first effort in this direction was made in
1726 (Geminiani being then in London), when he
formed Corelli&rsquo;s first six solos into concertos, a style
of composition then recently called into existence,
shortly afterwards treating another six in a similar
manner. Others underwent the same process, but to
these were added additional parts. Geminiani was
one of the first in the field of musical expression,
even sacrificing strict time to obtain it.</p>
<p>Locatelli furnishes us with another example, not
only of the advance of technique, but of the progress
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
of musical culture. His works called &ldquo;The Labyrinth,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The New Art of Modulation&rdquo; and &ldquo;Harmonic
Contrasts&rdquo; are alone sufficient to establish him
as a great reformer in the musical world of his
time. As we have elsewhere observed, Torelli is
credited with having fixed the form of the concerto,
and a few lesser lights, such as the two Veracinis and
Alberti, live to this day by their works. The next
master whose influence marked another step in the
development of classical music for the violin was
Guiseppe Tartini (1692-1770). Here we have a
man destined for all time to stand out as one of
the most indefatigable pioneers of the violin. In
his quadruple capacity as a performer, composer,
theorist and teacher, his influence was far-reaching,
and, what is more, it has been transmitted down to
the present time. As a composer, his style of
modulation was a new thing, and his performance
came as a revelation to those who heard him for the
first time. His &ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s Sonata&rdquo; is well-known to
all violinists.</p>
<p>We now arrive at a name which brings us in touch
with other members of the fiddle family. Luigi
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
Boccherini (1740-1806), who is justly considered the
father of chamber music for stringed instruments.
It was he who, in 1768, gave definition to the
form of the trio, the quartet and the quintet; forms
which have served for the models of all subsequent
composers. In the trio he was followed by Fiorillo,
Cramer, Giardini, Pugnani and Viotti, and in the
quartet by Mozart. His other styles were elaborated
by Haydn and Beethoven. Boccherini was a prolific
composer.</p>
<p>Three names should here be mentioned in
connection with the concerto, in whose hands it
underwent great improvement. They are Pugnani
(1728-1798), Jarnowick (1745-1804), and Mestrino
(1750-1790).</p>
<p>The next and last great representative of the
Italian school, and one who largely influenced the
French school, was Giovanni Battista Viotti (1755-1824),
a pupil of Pugnani. The name of Viotti
stands out with peculiar lustre, in that with him the
concerto arrived at a degree of perfection hardly
capable of being exceeded. The same may be said
of his trios and duos, both of which should be
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
studied and cultivated by every young violin aspirant.
In Viotti the Italians have certainly produced
a fitting tailpiece to a long line of brilliant composers
for the violin, a line in which no artistic hiatus
appears from the time of Corelli.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>The first to establish a French school was Jean
Marie Leclair (1679-1764). Although he received
his instructions from Somis, the Italian, and became
thoroughly imbued with Italian tastes and ideas,
he laboured incessantly, on his return to France, with
the object of establishing a distinct school for his
country, and in many respects he was successful. In
1723 he published a series of solos, and soon afterwards
six sonatas for two violins and bass; also
duos, trios and concertos.</p>
<p>The next to claim attention among the French
classical composers is Pierre Gavinies (1728-1800).
He was the first professor at the Paris Conservatoire,
then but recently formed, and the compositions he
contributed testify to considerable musical culture:
they are of great difficulty, and are, for the most
parts, sonatas and concertos.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>We now introduce three names who greatly
elaborated the forms fixed by the Italians, Rode
(1774-1830), Kreutzer (1766-1831) and Baillot (1771-1842).
This almost inseparable trio are so well
known to the student, that a lengthy comment would
be superfluous. They were all in turn professors at
the Paris Conservatoire, and the joint production of
their great method for the violin, coupled with their
other educational works, place them as prominent
classical writers. Rode is known by his concertos,
caprices and airs with variations. Kreutzer&rsquo;s forty
studies are a household word with the earnest
student, not to mention his concertos, duets, trios
and quartets; and the same may be said with regard
to Baillot&rsquo;s concertos, variations, and a host of other
pieces.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>We now pass on to consider shortly what the Germans
have handed down. Like other countries, they
have been largely indebted to the Italians; and, in
this connection, it is curious to note that with the
rise of music in Germany we find a gradual decadence
of the art in Italy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>In Germany we have to look to the great composers
rather than the great violinists for the most
important classical works for the violin.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to notice anything anterior to
the time of the great J. S. Bach (1685-1750); in fact,
very little took place in the nature of published
works.</p>
<p>That Bach possessed a sound perception of the
capabilities and resources of the violin is amply
demonstrated in all his writings for that instrument.
His acquaintance with the finger-board is only excelled
by his knowledge of the keyboard. Amongst
the almost innumerable works of this greatest musical
classic that has ever lived, I would mention his
three partitas and three sonatas for violin (without
accompaniment). The Chaconne in the D minor
Partita is a remarkable instance of Bach&rsquo;s immense
powers of perception.</p>
<p>The first real founder of a German school was
Leopold Mozart (1719-1787), father of the great
W. A. Mozart. He is not known by his instrumental
compositions, but his claim to notice exists in the
production of his &ldquo;Method&rdquo; for the violin, a work
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
which not only survived several editions, but assumed
the garb of several languages.</p>
<p>The next to call for notice is Joseph Haydn
(1732-1809), a most prolific composer, especially for
the string family. Attached to the service of Prince
Esterhazy, a patron immensely rich and passionately
fond of music, Haydn enjoyed a combination of
circumstances all concurring to give opportunity for
the display of his genius. It has been vouchsafed
to few musicians to pursue their art under such favourable
conditions as Haydn. He did not compose
to please either publisher or the public. So long as
his patron was satisfied with his productions, things
went on merrily with him.</p>
<p>Let us see what Haydn did for the instrument he
loved so much. Here they are&mdash;eighty-three quartets,
three concertos, twenty-one trios for two violins
and bass, six violin solos.</p>
<p>No review, however short, could lay claim to completeness
without mention of the following&mdash;viz.,
Mozart, Weber and Beethoven. To this noble trio
violinists owe much. It is, of course, quite beyond
the province of this work to even enumerate the
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
many compositions from the pens of these immortal
musicians in which the violin took part, but I would
call attention to Beethoven&rsquo;s glorious Concerto in D,
Op. 61, and his two lovely Romances in G and F
respectively.</p>
<p>Another great German musician who exercised
considerable influence on compositions of classic
mould was Louis Spohr (1784-1859). His great
fame as a composer, combined with his reputation as
a violin virtuoso of the highest order, places him in
a conspicuous position in the history of music. The
works of Spohr are probably so well known that no
useful purpose can be served in recounting their
great merits. Suffice it to say they are of the highest
possible pitch of excellence, and require more than
ordinary technical ability to do them justice. Considered
only as a composer, he has been indefatigable
in the production of every style of music, and
he was especially happy in that for the strings. His
beautiful D minor Concerto is one of the finest examples
of this class of music to be met with, and
its first introduction by the great master himself
made a great sensation. As one of Spohr&rsquo;s commentators
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
truly said, &ldquo;Mozart had written solid and
simple concertos, in which the performer was expected
to embroider and finish the composer&rsquo;s sketch,
and Beethoven&rsquo;s concertos were so written as to make
the solo player merely one of the orchestra. But,
as Mozart raised opera to a higher standard, so
Beethoven uplifted the ideal of the orchestra, so
Spohr&rsquo;s creative force as a violinist and writer for
the violin has established the grandest school for
this instrument, to which all the foremost contemporary
artists acknowledge their obligations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before taking leave of the German school I would
mention two other names&mdash;Joseph Mayseder and
Kalliwoda, both of whom contributed much that is
good, and their works consequently attained wide
popularity.</p>
<p>Let us now turn to our own country. We have
not, it must be admitted, occupied a front rank as
composers of violin music, hence the scarcity of classical
works handed down to us; but let us hasten
to add, we have produced the finest critics in the
world, and, what is more, we are thoroughly well
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
posted up in all the best pieces that have emanated
from the thoughts of the greatest composers.</p>
<p>One of the earliest who wrote for the violin was
one Rogers, who, in the year 1653, wrote airs in four
parts for violins. He was followed by John Jenkins,
who wrote twelve sonatas for two violins and
a bass, printed in 1664, which were the first sonatas
written by an Englishman.</p>
<p>James Sherard also composed several sonatas in
the beginning of the last century, and they are said
to bear such a resemblance to Corelli&rsquo;s that they
might have been taken for that composer&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The compositions of Handel materially advanced
the violin in this country, and the establishment by
him of Italian opera was the means of bringing us
in touch with the great Italian performers and
writers.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
